            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p>National Service Scheme IIT Madras is a student-run organization that was initiated over four decades ago with a vision to benefit society in every possible way. We at NSS function with a mission to mobilize the youth into a sect of progressive citizens and imbibe in them an inclination towards social service.</p>

            <h1>What do we do?</h1>
            <p>NSS IIT Madras intakes more than 300 active students each year, from all respective years and batches, who contribute to the cause of the scheme. Over the years, we have undergone a series of structural and ideological changes to foster creativity and innovation in all our activities. By working on projects ranging from Braille magazines to technology interventions, teaching children in urban slums to creating educational video content, NSS IITM seeks to challenge mediocre thinking and reach out into the darkness, pulling a hand into the light. We work on a diverse range of social issues including blood donation, animal care, teaching, and environmental issues, collaborating with several NGOs on various social challenges.</p>
